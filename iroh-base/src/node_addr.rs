//! Addressing for iroh nodes.
//!
//! This module contains some common addressing types for iroh.  A node is uniquely
//! identified by the [`NodeId`] but that does not make it addressable on the network layer.
//! For this the addition of a [`RelayUrl`] and/or direct addresses are required.
//!
//! The primary way of addressing a node is by using the [`NodeAddr`].

/// Network-level addressing information for an iroh-net node.
///
/// This combines a node's identifier with network-level addressing information of how to
/// contact the node.
///
/// To establish a network connection to a node both the [`NodeId`] and one or more network
/// paths are needed.  The network paths can come from various sources:
///
/// - A [discovery] service which can provide routing information for a given [`NodeId`].
///
/// - A [`RelayUrl`] of the node's [home relay], this allows establishing the connection via
///   the Relay server and is very reliable.
///
/// - One or more *direct addresses* on which the node might be reachable.  Depending on the
///   network location of both nodes it might not be possible to establish a direct
///   connection without the help of a [Relay server].
///
/// This structure will always contain the required [`NodeId`] and will contain an optional
/// number of network-level addressing information.  It is a generic addressing type used
/// whenever a connection to other nodes needs to be established.
