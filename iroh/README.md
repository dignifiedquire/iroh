# iroh

The iroh crate defines both the `iroh` library and `iroh` command-line interface (CLI).

For more details on Iroh, see https://iroh.computer.

## Building the CLI

Simply run `cargo build` from the project root, it produces the `iroh` CLI by default.

## Using as a rust crate

Because iroh builds the CLI by default, you should disable `default-features` when importing the `iroh` crate via cargo:

```toml
[dependencies]
iroh = { version = "...", default-features = false }
```

## Running Examples

Examples are located in `iroh/examples`. Run them with `cargo run --features=examples --example`. eg: `cargo run --features=examples --example hello-world`. At the top of each example file is a comment describing how to run the example.
