//! Handle downloading blobs and collections concurrently and from peers.
//!
//! The [`Downloader`] interacts with four main components to this end.
//! - [`Dialer`]: Used to queue opening connections to peers we need to perform downloads.
//! - [`ProviderMap`]: Where the downloader obtains information about peers that could be
//!   used to perform a download.
//! - [`Store`]: Where data is stored.
//! - [`CollectionParser`]: Used by the Get state machine logic to identify blobs encoding
//!   collections.
//!
//! Once a download request is received, the logic is as follows:
//! 1. The [`ProviderMap`] is queried for peers. From these peers some are selected
//!    prioritizing connected peers with lower number of active requests. If no useful peer is
//!    connected, or useful connected peers have no capacity to perform the request, a connection
//!    attempt is started using the [`Dialer`].
//! 2. The download is queued for processing at a later time. Downloads are not performed right
//!    away. Instead, they are initially delayed to allow the peer to obtain the data itself, and
//!    to wait for the new connection to be established if necessary.
//! 3. Once a request is ready to be sent after a delay (initial or for a retry), the preferred
//!    peer is used if available. The request is now considered active.
//!
//! Concurrency is limited in different ways:
//! - *Total number of active request:* This is a way to prevent a self DoS by overwhelming our own
//!   bandwidth capacity. This is a best effort heuristic since it doesn't take into account how
//!   much data we are actually requesting or receiving.
//! - *Total number of connected peers:* Peer connections are kept for a longer time than they are
//!   strictly needed since it's likely they will be useful soon again.
//! - *Requests per peer*: to avoid overwhelming peers with requests, the number of concurrent
//!   requests to a single peer is also limited.
