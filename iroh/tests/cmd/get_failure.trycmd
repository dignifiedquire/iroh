Getting something that's not a proper path to a CID fails with an error:

```
$ iroh get /something
? failed
error: Invalid value '/something' for '<IPFS_PATH>': invalid cid

For more information try '--help'

```


Getting something that's not a CID fails too:

```
$ iroh get QmP8jTG1m9GSDJLCbeWhVSVg
? failed
error: Invalid value 'QmP8jTG1m9GSDJLCbeWhVSVg' for '<IPFS_PATH>': invalid cid

For more information try '--help'

```

Getting something that's a proper path but does not include a CID is also an error:

```
$ iroh get /ipns/foo
? failed
Error: IPFS path does not refer to a CID

```
