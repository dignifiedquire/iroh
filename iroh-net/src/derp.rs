//! Package derp implements the Designated Encrypted Relay for Packets (DERP)
//! protocol written by Tailscale.
//
//! DERP routes packets to clients using curve25519 keys as addresses.
//
//! DERP is used by proxy encrypted QUIC packets through the DERP servers when
//! a direct path cannot be found or opened. DERP is a last resort. Both side
//! between very aggressive NATs, firewalls, no IPv6, etc? Well, DERP.
//! Based on tailscale/derp/derp.go
