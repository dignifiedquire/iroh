//! iroh-net provides connectivity for iroh.
//!
//! This crate is a collection of tools to establish connectivity between peers.  At
//! the high level [`Endpoint`] is used to establish a QUIC connection with
//! authenticated peers, relaying and holepunching support.
//!
//! The "relay-only" feature forces all traffic to send over the relays. We still
//! receive traffic over udp and relay. This feature should only be used for testing.
