# Derp Regions

A DERP region is a collection of DERP nodes in a relatively similar geographical area. All the DERP nodes in a single DERP region are connected to every other node in that region through a mesh network. They can all act as packet forwarders for each other. When an Iroh peer starts up, it does a latency test to see which region it is “closest to”. That region is considered the Iroh peer’s home region.

A peer may be connected to multiple regions, but it will advertise its home region as the one best used to hole-punch or relay packets through.

You do not need to know a peer's DERP region in order to connect to them directly, if there are no firewalls or NATs between the two peers trying to connect. However, to have any hole punching, you must have that peer's DERP region.

It may also be possible that the DERP region specified is one that your Iroh node knows nothing about. However, that is unlikely to happen if you use the default regions and nodes we have specified here. These DERP regions are defaults in the code.

We currently have 2 derp regions, with a single node in each.

Region ID `65535` is reserved for testing and experiments.

## North America

```rust

    DerpRegion {
        region_id: 1,
        nodes: vec![
                DerpNode {
                    name: "default-1".into(),
                    region_id: 1,
                    url: format!("https://use1-1.derp.iroh.network")
                        .parse()
                        .unwrap(),
                    stun_only: false,
                    stun_port: 3478,
                    ipv4: UseIpv4::Some(std::net::Ipv4Addr::new(34, 207, 161, 128)),
                    ipv6: UseIpv6::TryDns,
                    stun_test_ip: None,
                }
			],
        avoid: false,
        region_code: "default-1".into(),
    }

## Europe

```rust

    DerpRegion {
        region_id: 2,
        nodes: vec![
                DerpNode {
                    name: "default-1".into(),
                    region_id: 2,
                    url: format!("https://euw1-1.derp.iroh.network.")
                        .parse()
