//! Package derp implements the Designated Encrypted Relay for Packets (DERP)
//! protocol.
//
//! DERP routes packets to clients using curve25519 keys as addresses.
//
//! DERP is used by Tailscale nodes to proxy encrypted WireGuard
//! packets through the Tailscale cloud servers when a direct path
//! cannot be found or opened. DERP is a last resort. Both side
//! between very aggressive NATs, firewalls, no IPv6, etc? Well, DERP.
//! Based on tailscale/derp/derp.go
